<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Welcome! I am Monique, a social science researcher from South Africa. My research has focused on geopolitics, governance, conflict and climate change, with a regional focus on Africa. My work involves quantitative methods using spatial, survey and socio-economic data with qualitative sources such as interviews and archival material.</p> <p>Currently, I work as a researcher and policy dialogue manager at the <a href="https://policyinnovationlab.sun.ac.za/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Policy Innovation Lab</a> at Stellenbosch University within the School for Data Science and Computational Thinking. In this role, I support the South African presidency by convening high-level policy dialogues, producing briefing materials and translating research into accessible formats for policymakers. My work sits at the intersection between academic research, public policy and stakeholder engagement, with a particular emphasis on governance reform, digital and AI policy and complex systems challenges.</p> <p>In December 2025, I defended my PhD in Political Science at Stellenbosch University. My doctoral research was conducted as part of the <a href="https://www.prio.org/projects/1931" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DISARM</a> project at the Peace Research Institute of Oslo (PRIO) where I was awarded a full three-year doctoral scholarship, including dedicated research funding. My thesis examined the implementation dynamics of the United Nations peacebuilding mission in Mozambique (ONUMOZ), with a focus on disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR). Drawing on newly declassified UN archival material and in-depth interviews, I developed an analytical framework to trace how actors, place and time interacted during implementation to better explain the process. The research bridges historical approaches to studying DDR, the spatial turn in peacebuilding research and policy implementation studies, offering new empirical insight into why formally successful peace processes may remain institutionally fragile over time.</p> <p>Previously, I worked as a Senior Researcher at Good Governance Africa, where I led applied, data-driven research on governance performance, elections, political violence, climate risk and human security across sub-Saharan Africa. During this period, I designed election-tracking frameworks, co-developed a sub-national Governance Performance Index for South Africa and produced policy-relevant research for both specialist and public audiences. I regularly collaborated with external partners, contributed to media commentary and supported organisational capacity-building through data analysis and research design.</p> <p>I have a strong interest in quantitative methods, particularly using R for data analysis, geospatial analysis and visualisation. I enjoy working with various kinds of datasets and am especially interested in how visual tools can improve analytical clarity and research communication. I have experience tutoring at undergraduate and postgraduate level and have led training in R for social scientists, supporting colleagues and students to develop confidence in coding, analysis and visualisation. I am particularly motivated by making quantitative methods more accessible to African early-career researchers from non-technical backgrounds.</p> </body></html>
