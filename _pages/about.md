Welcome! I am Monique, a social science researcher from South Africa. My research focuses on conflict and peacebuilding, governance and electoral politics as well as climate-related risks in sub-Saharan Africa. 

Currently, I work as a researcher and policy dialogue manager at the [**Policy Innovation Lab**](https://policyinnovationlab.sun.ac.za/) at Stellenbosch University within the School for Data Science and Computational Thinking. 

I completed my PhD in Political Science at Stellenbosch University in 2025, as part of the [**DISARM**](https://www.prio.org/projects/1931) project at [**PRIO**](https://www.prio.org/). My doctoral research analysed the implementation of the UN peacebuilding mission in Mozambique (ONUMOZ), with a focus on disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) using newly declassified archival data and interviews.

Previously, I worked as a researcher at [**Good Governance Africa**](https://gga.org/), where I contributed to data-driven research on governance performance, elections, political violence, climate risk and human security across Africa. Before that, I completed my **MA in International Relations** at [Wits University](https://www.wits.ac.za/) supervised by Prof Rod Alence.

I have a strong interest in quantitative methods for social science research. I use R for quantitative and geospatial analysis and data visualisation, and I teach and mentor early-career researchers to build accessible quantitative skills in Africa.
